This repo will contain the html/php files used to generate my "grocery store".

The Store page will be written in html/php with a connection to mysql database which will house:

Items in the store
Employees of the store
Passwords for the employees to login and update information based on user request.

The user searches for an item. If it exists, its price and name are displayed. 
If it does not exist, the user is asked if we should carry that item in the store.

Upon confirmation, a request is made and entered into another table.
The manager will login (credentials confirmed) and approve or deny the request.
